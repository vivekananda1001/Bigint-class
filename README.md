# BigInt-Class
A Class to handle integer bigger than 64 bits in C++

BigInt.h file contain the class along with declartions and definations of all the function to do arthematic in big integers.

Demonstration 1 is the implementation of Bigint class in printing factorial of any large number without overflowing.

Demonstration 2 is the implementation of Bigint class in printing any large number raised to some large power. ( here we do n^n )

Output 1 is the output image of demonstration 1 while printing factorial of 100 without overflowing.

Output 2 is the output image of demonstration 2 while printing result of 150 raised to the power of 150 without overflowing.
